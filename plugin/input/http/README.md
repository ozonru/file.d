# HTTP plugin
Reads events from HTTP requests with body delimited by a new line.

Also it emulates some protocols to allow receive events from wide range of software which use HTTP to transmit data.
E.g. `file.d` may pretends to be Elasticsearch allows clients to send events using Elasticsearch protocol.
So you can use Elasticsearch filebeat output plugin to send data to `file.d`.

> âš  Currently event commitment mechanism isn't implemented for this plugin.
> Plugin answers with HTTP code `OK 200` right after it have read all the request body.
> It doesn't wait until events will be committed.
